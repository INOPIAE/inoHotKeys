Small application to have hotkeys that are available across all windows applications.

Currently these hot keys are available:

* Create a new email if Outlook is available.
* Send Windows to sleep.

The GUI supports currently the following languages:

* English

The application tries to find the current language settings from the current Windows settings. In case the Windows language cannot be found English is taken as default language. The language can be chosen in the Options.

When the application is started you can find the application in the icon tray.
